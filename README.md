# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
The best way to ensure that code is functional is to properly test it.  To properly test code, one must test as much of it as possible, with the goal of maximizing the test coverage (generally above 80% is acceptable).  This ensures that the code can't be used improperly, and that it will not allow for failure.  

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Before coding, it is imparative that the user's needs are properly and completely stated so that they can be used as a requirement list.  The best way to do this is to have the user create a list of the most important aspects of the system.  What it must be able to do, what it must not be able to do.  Then, turn that list of aspects into a list of programming requirements that will dictate how the code is written.  

# How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, user needs take absolute priority.  If the software doesn't complete its given purpose, it is useless, and possibly even dangerous.  That is why it is vital that its requirements are clearly stated before any coding is done.  This makes for a more productive Software Development Life Cycle, because there is a much smaller chance of errors being created.
